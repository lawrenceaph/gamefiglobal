# Gaming and Decentralized Finance= GameFi
Lets walk through some of the fundamental concepts in GameFi.

## Gaming (Before GameFi)

The gaming industry commenced circa 1970, and has since then grown into the highest-earning media domain globally (160 Billion USD in 2020), handily defeating Television, Film Box Office, and Music. There's a useful chart that illustrates 50 years of gaming industry history [here](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/history-of-gaming-by-revenue-share-full-size.html).

The valuation above does not include the added resources brought in from the mix of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi). But what is DeFi?

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Decentralized Finance, as the name implies, is a cryptocurrency finance ecosystem that runs without centralized control. The applications, protocols, smart contracts, and related blockchain technologies that compose DeFi are governed and owned by its users, not a single  entity, state, or agency. 

In a centralized finance structure, the monetary framework cannot be controlled by ordinary citizens. The central authority determines how legal tender can be spent, and only that authority can perform adjustments to protect the public from runaway inflation or currency devaluation. 

Meanwhile, in DeFi, the decentralized nature of the ecosystem means that - at least in theory - there is no entity that can unilaterally own all of its components or exercise dominion over the system. For good or for bad - the stakeholders and users of the system are given the power and responsibility to nurture a fair and equitable platform. As the platform is always voluntary, no one is forced to stay or leave.  

DeFi's decentralization is illustrated in mechanisms such as governance tokens that give holders the power to vote on key upgrades and modifications to DeFi platforms. The big idea is that those with the greatest investment / skin in the game should have the most say as to where the platform goes next. 

There's a lot to talk about when it comes to DeFi, such as the importance and value of regulation- but that is for another post and another time. Let's turn our attention now to GameFi! 

## GameFi

GameFi combines gaming and decentralized finance to create a new experience for users who derive utility from both gaming and DeFi. Examples of GameFi include Zoo Crypto World, Mobox, and Jojo Fun Metaverse. 

Common elements in such platforms include (1) the use of non-fungible tokens to ensure users have proof that they own unique assets, (2) a means to stake NFTs to earn tokens, (3) a game dimension where the NFTs are used to create new NFTs or battle other NFTs or in-game characters, and (4) a liquidity or staking pool of some kind that allows users to earn yield passively. 

There are tons of other platforms out there, and interested seekers will no doubt find a treasure trove of projects to choose from.  Happy Hunting!
