# Gaming and Decentralized Finance= GameFi

## Gaming (Before GameFi)

The gaming industry commenced circa 1970, and has since then grown into the highest-earning media domain globally (160 Billion USD in 2020), handily defeating Television, Film Box Office, and Music. There's a useful chart that illustrates 50 years of gaming industry history [here](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/history-of-gaming-by-revenue-share-full-size.html).

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Decentralized Finance, as the name implies, is a cryptocurrency finance ecosystem that runs without centralized control. The applications, protocols, smart contracts, and related blockchain technologies that compose DeFi are governed and owned by its users, not a single  entity, state, or agency. 

The decentralized nature of the ecosystem means that - at least in theory - there is no entity that can unilaterally own all of its components or exercise dominion over the system. 

DeFi's decentralization is illustrated in mechanisms such as governance tokens that give holders (as opposed to the creators of the tokens per se) the power to vote on key upgrades and modifications to DeFi platforms. The big idea is that those with the greatest investment / skin in the game should have the most say as to where the platform goes next. 

## GameFi

GameFi combines gaming and decentralized finance to create a new experience for users who derive utility from both gaming and DeFi. Examples of GameFi include Zoo Crypto World, Mobox, and Jojo Fun Metaverse. There are a ton of other platforms out there, and interested seekers will no doubt find a treasure trove of projects to choose from.  Happy Hunting!
